https://weatherstack.com was not allowing me to use API in free subsciption . so i created using different weather service
it was giving this error : 105	function_access_restricted	The user's current subscription does not support this API function.

there is no UV index data in there so i change the second question little bit
i ask to wear jacket if temperature feels like below 77 F
Instead of this question (Should I wear sunscreen?)

user have to enter the city name , and answers will appear below according to the questions, based on Data in API
